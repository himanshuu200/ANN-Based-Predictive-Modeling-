# ANN-Based Predictive Modeling üß†üìä
Harnessing the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for predictive analytics!

This project showcases the implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for predictive modeling tasks. ANNs are a foundational deep learning architecture capable of solving complex problems like regression, classification, and pattern recognition. This repository provides a clear and practical implementation of ANNs, along with tools for training, evaluating, and visualizing results on various datasets.

# Features ‚ú®

ANN Implementation: A hands-on implementation of Artificial Neural Networks.

Predictive Modeling: Solve regression and classification problems using ANNs.

Data Preprocessing: Tools for preparing and normalizing data for training.

Visualization: Plotting tools to analyze model performance and predictions.

Flexible and Customizable: Easily adapt the model to your own dataset.

# How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

Data Preparation: The dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and split into training and testing sets.

Model Training: An ANN model is built and trained on the dataset.

Prediction: The trained model is used to make predictions on new data.

Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or Mean Squared Error (MSE).

#Technologies Used üíª

TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the ANN model.

Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics and data splitting.

# Applications üåê

Regression tasks (e.g., predicting house prices, sales forecasting)

Classification tasks (e.g., image recognition, spam detection)

Pattern recognition and feature extraction

Predictive analytics in finance, healthcare, and more
